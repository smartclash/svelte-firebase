An simple SvelteJS powered app that has authentication built using Firebase Auth. No extra fuss.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
